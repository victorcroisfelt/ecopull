## Abstract
This paper introduces EcoPull, a sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) framework powered by Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) models for efficient image retrieval from multiple devices. The devices are equipped with two types of TinyML models: i) a behavior model and ii) an image compressor model. The behavior model filters out irrelevant images based on the current task, minimizing unnecessary data transmission and reducing communication resource competition among devices. The image compressor model enables devices to communicate with the edge server (ES) using latent representations of images, thereby reducing communication bandwidth usage. While integrating TinyML models into IoT devices does increase energy consumption due to the inference process, this cost is carefully accounted for in our design. Numerical results show that the proposed framework can achieve over 77% and 43% energy savings compared to the simple offloading and a state-of-the-art baseline while still maintaining the quality of the retrieved images at the ES.
